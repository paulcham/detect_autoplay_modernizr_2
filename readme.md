Detect_autoplay.js for Modernizr 2
=========

This is simply a version of detect_autoplay.js that can be used as a Modernizr 2 test (Modernizr 3 already has a test for [autoplay](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/master/feature-detects/video/autoplay.js)).


That's it. Thanks to the original [author](https://github.com/knoxmodernmedia/detect_autoplay) for all the real work - I just wrapped it up for Modernizr 2.
